          Automatically detect and remove fake Google Business listings that
          impersonate your brand—before customers get scammed. Kredentic helps
          businesses protect customers from scammers who create fake Google
          listings that copy a brand name and replace the real phone number.
          When customers call, they think they&apos;re reaching you—but can end up
          paying fraudsters instead. You add your verified business details
          once, and Kredentic continuously scans for impersonation in the
          background, classifies risk, and drives the workflow from detection to
          evidence to takedown—keeping a clear outcome for each case (resolved,
          under review, or action needed) and a complete audit trail for your
          team.

          blockchain. The platform enables manga enthusiasts to read their
          favorite series while directly supporting creators through
          cryptocurrency, addressing long-standing issues of fair compensation
          in the manga and anime industry.

          The platform features an immersive reading experience with
          anime-inspired design aesthetics, integrating Web3 technology to
          create a sustainable ecosystem for manga creators and fans. Users can
          access manga content, participate in the community, and contribute to
          a movement advocating for creator rights and fair compensation. By
          combining blockchain technology with manga distribution, Shonen Pump
          represents a new model for content consumption that prioritizes
          creator welfare.
